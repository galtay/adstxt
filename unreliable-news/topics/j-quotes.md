Glimpses into Watergate-era journalism…

<h3 id="watergate">All the President's Men</h3>
All the President's Men, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (1974)

<blockquote>Gradually, an unwritten rule was evolving: unless two sources confirmed a charge involving activity likely to be considered criminal, the specific allegation was not used in the paper.<br> 
(pg 79)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I don't care if it's a word, a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a whole story or an entire series of stories," he said. "When in doubt, leave it out."  
—Howard Simons, Managing Editor, Washington Post<br>
(pg 114)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rule was: Lay it out piece by piece, white what you know is solid; the big picture can wait.<br>  
(pg 129)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Nixon White House worried him. "They are all underhanded and unknowable," he had said numerous times. He also distrusted the press. "I don't like newspapers," he had said flatly. He detested inexactitude and shallowness.  
—Deep Throat<br>
(pg 131)</blockquote>


Afterword, Marking the fortieth anniversary of Watergate
<blockquote><strong>The war on the news media</strong>

In response to suspected leaks to the press about Vietnam, Kissinger had ordered FBI wiretaps in 1969 on the telephones of 17 journalists and White House aides, without court approval. Many news stories based on the purported leaks questioned progress in the American war effort, further fueling the antiwar movement. In a tape from the Oval Office on Feb. 22, 1971, Nixon said, “In the short run, it would be so much easier, wouldn’t it, to run this war in a dictatorial way, kill all the reporters and carry on the war.”

“The press is your enemy,” Nixon explained five days later in a meeting with Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to another tape. “Enemies. Understand that? . . . Now, never act that way . . . give them a drink, you know, treat them nice, you just love it, you’re trying to be helpful. But don’t help the bastards. Ever. Because they’re trying to stick the knife right in our groin.”<br>

"Woodward and Bernstein: 40 years after Watergate, Nixon was far worse than we thought"

<h3>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</h3>  
<blockquote>Objective Journalism is a hard thing to come by these days. We all yearn for it, but who can point the way? The only man who comes to mind, right offhand, is my good friend and colleague on the Sports Desk, Raoul Duke. Most journalists only <em>talk</em> about objectivity, but Dr. Duke grabs it straight by the fucking throat. You will be hard-pressed to find any argument, among professionals, on the question of Dr. Duke's Objectivity.
 
As for mine ... well, my doctor says it swole up and busted about :en years ago. The only thing I ever saw that came dose to Objective Journalism was a closed-circuit TV setup that watched shoplifters in the General Store at Woody Creek, Colorado. I always admired that machine, but I noticed that nobody paid much attention to it until one of those known, heavy, out-front shoplifters came into the place ... but when that happened, everybody got so excited that the thief had to do something quick, like buy a green popsicle or a can of Coors and get out -the place immediately. 

So much for Objective Journalism. Don't bother to look for it here —
not under any byline of mine; or anyone else I can think of. With the possible exception of things like box scores, race results, and stock mar­tabulations, there is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.<br>

<blockquote>We were halfway down the ramp to the parking lot before I understood what had happened. "That gin-soaked little Nazi from the <em>Gazette</em> got pissed off when you didn't doff your hat for the national anthem," Burgin explained. "He kept bitching about you to the guy in charge of :he press box, then he got that asshole who works for him all cranked up and they started talking about having you arrested." 

"Jesus creeping shit," I muttered. "Now I know why I got out of sportswriting. Christ, I had no idea what was happening. You should have warned me." 

"I was afraid you'd run amok," he said. "We'd have been in bad trouble. All those guys from things like the <em>Norfolk Ledger</em> and the <em>Army-Navy Times</em>. They would have stomped us like rats in a closet." 

I couldn't understand it. "Hell, I'd have taken the goddamn hat off, if thought it was causing trouble. I barely even <em>remember</em> the national anthem. Usually, I don't even stand up." 

"I didn't think you were going to," he said. "I didn't want to say anything, but I knew we were doomed." 

"But I did stand," I said. "I figured, hell, I'm Dave's guest — why not stand and make it easy for him? But I never even thought about my god­damn hat." 

Actually, I was happy to get out of that place. The Redskins were losing, which pleased me, and we were thrown out just in time to get back to Burgin's house for the 49er game on TY. If they won this one, they would go against the Redskins next Sunday in the playoffs — and by the end of the third quarter I had worked myself into a genuine hate frenzy; I was howling like a butcher when the 49ers pulled it out in the final moments with a series of desperate maneuvers, and the moment the gun sounded I was on the phone to TWA, securing a seat on the Christmas Nite Special to San Francisco. It was extremely important, I felt, to go out there and do everything possible to make sure the Redskins got the mortal piss beaten out of them.<br>

<blockquote>After two or three weeks of this madness, you begin to feel As One with the man who said, "No news is good news." In twenty-eight papers, only the rarest kind of luck will turn up more than two or three articles of any interest ... but even then the interest items are usually buried deep around paragraph 16 on the jump (or "Cont. on... ") page... 

The <em>Post</em> will have a story about Muskie making a speech in Iowa. The <em>Star</em> will say the same thing, and the <em>Journal</em> will say nothing at all. But the <em>Times</em> might have enough room on the jump page to include a line or so that says something like: "When he finished his speech, Muskie burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck. They grappled briefly, but the struggle was kicked apart by an oriental woman who seemed to be in control."

Now that's good journalism. Totally objective; very active and straight to the point. But we need to know more. <em>Who</em> was that woman? <em>Why</em> did they fight? <strong>Where</strong> was Muskie taken? <em>What</em> was he saying when the microphone broke?<br>

<blockquote>"Just a bunch of pansies from CBS and the New York Times, hanging around the bar," he said. "I took a few bites out of that crowd and they faded fast — just ran off like curs. But what the shit can you expect from people like that? Just a bunch of lowlife ass-kissers who get paid for hanging around with politicians."<br>
(pg 93)</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Yes .... The Zoo Plane: I'm not sure who named it chat, but the name derived from the nature of the behavior of the people on it ... It was very much like a human zoo, and I recall particularly that last flight from Long Beach to Sioux Falls ... I remembe1 Tim Crouse's description of how the older and straighter press people muse have felt when they saw five or six freaks reeling around in the cockpit on takeoff and landing, passing joints around. As Tim said, you can imagine how these guys felt. They had heard all these terrible things, they'd read stories about how people in dark corners gathered to pass drugs around, and they always thought that it happened in urine-soaked doorways around Times Square. But all of a sudden here we were covering a presidential campaign and there were joints being passed up and down the aisle: weird people in the cockpit ... drug addicts ... lunatics ... crowding into the cockpit just to get high and wired on the lights. The cockpit had millions of lights all around it ... green lights ... red lights ... all kinds of blinking things — a wonderful place to be. That surge of power in a jet ... you don't gee any real sense of it back in the passenger seats, but the feeling ... up in front is like riding God's own motorcycle.<br>

<h3>Murrow</h3>
<blockquote>American traditions and the American ethic require us to be truthful, but the most important reason is that truth is the best propaganda and lies are the worst. To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful. It is as simple as that.<br>

<h3>All the President's Men, Revisited</h3>

<blockquote>Fred Thompson, who before he was a senator and an actor on “Law & Order” was the lead counsel to the Republicans on the Senate committee investigating Watergate, is still gleeful as he recalls the damning testimony of John Dean, the White House counsel who described the president’s role in the cover-up. “You can’t have anything worse happen to you than your own lawyer turning against you,” Mr. Thompson says with a deep chuckle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ben Stein, who is glimpsed as a young man in the footage of doleful White House staffers listening to Nixon’s farewell speech in the East Room (“My mother was a saint,” etc.), reflects on it once more: “It’s really sad. I don’t think any president has been more persecuted than Nixon. I think he was a saint.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1:23:20) One thing about Watergate: It was gonna change the culture of Washington. It did no such thing. You know this kind of thing is going to happen again. And it's going to happen in a much, much bigger scale.<br>
