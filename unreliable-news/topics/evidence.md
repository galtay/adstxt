Ways to provide evidence and justification for declaring a site unreliable.

## Merge more sites

The more fake-new lists that include a site, the more likley that site is fake news. (Caveat: some lists have identical sources.) The Unreliable News Sites (UNS) index at CJR merges five lists:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2017/07/websites-post-fake-satirical-stories/">FactCheck.org’s Misinformation Directory</a> (FC)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fakenewscodex.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fake News Codex</a> (FN)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.opensources.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSources</a> (OS)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/article/2017/apr/20/politifacts-guide-fake-news-websites-and-what-they/">PolitiFact’s Fake News Almanac</a> (PF)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/">Snopes’ Field Guide to Fake News Sites and Hoax Purveyors</a> (SN)</li>
</ul>
