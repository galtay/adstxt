Maciej Cegłowski, of <a href="https://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>, says their real goal isn't CPM, it's VC and "Investor Storytime":
<blockquote>
<p>Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.</p>

<p>Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.</p>

<p>That's the essence of investor storytime. Give us money now, and you won't believe how awesome our ads will be when we finally put them on the site.</p>

<p>We're addicted to 'big data' not because it's effective now, but because we need it to tell better stories.</p>

Not only is ad tech cluttering up people's screens with ads that are designed to deliver accidental clicks that are near-impossible to avoid, those ads come with scripts to turn your user behavior into their big data -- and those scripts have significant bandwidth attached. In other words, a very significant chunk of your data plan, battery life and time waiting for sites to load are costs you pay to watch the very same ads that are messing up your customer experience.

The Online Ad Scams Every Marketer Should Watch Out For  
https://hbr.org/2015/10/the-online-ad-scams-every-marketer-should-watch-out-for
>In a remarkable experiment, economist Steve Tadelis and coauthors turned off eBay’s trademark-triggered advertising in about half the cities in the U.S. They found that sales in those regions stayed the same even as eBay’s advertising expenditure dropped. eBay’s measure of ad effectiveness was totally off-base and had led to millions of dollars of overspending.

The Fake Traffic Schemes That Are Rotting the Internet - Bloomberg Business  
http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/
> The ideal programmatic transaction works like this: A user clicks on a website and suddenly her Internet address and browsing history are packaged and whisked off to an auction site, where software, on behalf of advertisers, scrutinizes her profile (or an anonymized version of it) and determines whether to bid to place an ad next to that article. Ford Motor could pay to put its ads on websites for car buffs, or, with the help of cookies, track car buffs wherever they may be online. Ford might want to target males age 25-40 for pickup-truck ads, or, better yet, anybody in that age group who’s even read about pickups in the past six months.…

> Ron Amram is at Heineken USA now, where the annual ad budget is in the $150 million range. In 2013 the company replaced its old stubby bottles with a fashionably long-necked version that supposedly keeps the beer cold longer. “We had a healthy investment in TV, local media, and digital,” he says. “We thought digital would come close and compete with television in terms of effectiveness.” 

> Late that year he and a half-dozen or so colleagues gathered in a New York conference room for a presentation on the performance of the online ads. They were stunned. Digital’s return on investment was around 2 to 1, a $2 increase in revenue for every $1 of ad spending, compared with at least 6 to 1 for TV. The most startling finding: Only 20 percent of the campaign’s “ad impressions”—ads that appear on a computer or smartphone screen—were even seen by actual people. 

> “The room basically stopped,” Amram recalls. The team was concerned about their jobs; someone asked, “Can they do that? Is it legal?” But mostly it was disbelief and outrage. “It was like we’d been throwing our money to the mob,” Amram says. “As an advertiser we were paying for eyeballs and thought that we were buying views. But in the digital world, you’re just paying for the ad to be served, and there’s no guarantee who will see it, or whether a human will see it at all.”… 

<img src="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/img/pq3.jpg" />

> “I can think of nothing that has done more harm to the Internet than ad tech,” says Bob Hoffman, a veteran ad executive, industry critic, and author of the blog the Ad Contrarian. “It interferes with everything we try to do on the Web. It has cheapened and debased advertising and spawned criminal empires.”… 

<img src="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/img/bannerdivider1.gif" /> 

> The traffic market is unregulated, and sellers range from unimpeachable to adequate to downright sleazy; price is part of the market’s code. The cheap stuff is very easy to find. On LinkedIn there’s a forum called “Buying & Selling TRAFFIC,” where 1,000 “visitors” can be had for $1.… 

> Soon after it started buying traffic, Bonnier’s numbers began to jump. In the summer of 2014, several of the video sites had almost zero visitors, according to ComScore. By December, Saveur.tv had 6 million monthly visitors and WorkingMotherTV.com, 4 million, according to site data provided by Bonnier. In May traffic surged again: 9 million for Saveur.tv; 5 million for WorkingMotherTV.com.… 

<img src="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-click-fraud/img/flowchart.png" />

> And if advertisers don’t like it, he adds, “they should go buy somewhere else. They want to pay only a little and get a lot of traffic and results. If they want all human traffic, they should go direct to the publisher and pay more.”… 

> Programmatic advertising has become such a tangle of data firms, marketing firms, strategy firms, and ad tech companies that it can be hard even for the biggest brands to keep track of it all. Three years ago executives at Kellogg started to notice that spots for Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts, and Special K were running on sketchy websites, hidden in pop-under windows, or compressed into screens as tiny as a single pixel. Others were displayed on sites where much of the “audience” was bots. “It turns out I’m buying from this guy down the street who opens up his coat and says, ‘Hey, you want to buy some ads?’ ” says Jim Kiszka, the food company’s senior manager for digital strategy. 

> The situation became more infuriating when Kellogg tried to get a simple breakdown: How much was each part of the labyrinthine digital-ad process costing? Answers were impossible to come by. Kellogg asked for itemized bills from the various ad agencies and data companies it hired, but they all refused. “It wasn’t a smoking gun,” Kiszka says. “It was more like a detective story where you had to piece together the evidence. And it was clear that in a system with that little transparency, there was bound to be problems.” 

> In response, Kellogg’s in-house ad department assumed control of its contracts with publishers and ad platforms such as Google and Yahoo, removing the agencies from the process. Kellogg started using software that alerted it when ads ran on suspect sites and refused to do business with any sites that wouldn’t allow third-party validators to screen for bad traffic. Kiszka says the company has seen a 50 percent to 75 percent drop in bot traffic and a significant jump in its return on investment in advertising for Raisin Bran and Corn Flakes.

> Print Still Pays 

> -- Globally, more than 93 per cent of all newspaper revenues still come from print, and print will continue to be a major source of revenue for many years to come. At the same time, newspapers around the world are investing efforts and are increasingly innovative in turning the business model from two-dimensional to multi-dimensional.

High-Speed Ad Traders Profit by Arbitraging Your Eyeballs - Bloomberg  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-07/high-speed-ad-traders-profit-by-arbitraging-your-eyeballs
> The high-frequency trading pioneered on Wall Street has come to Madison Avenue. 
Arbitragers are buying millions of online ads and reselling them for a profit in the blink of an eye. They’re exploiting price discrepancies in a fast-evolving marketplace, where this year companies around the world will spend an estimated $9.33 billion on display and banner ads at auction.… 

> When you open a web page, information such as age, sex, location and search history are zapped to buyers vying for your attention. Bundled with 999 other people, those eyeballs are offered to the highest bidder, usually ad agencies and their clients, which can range from big public companies such as Apple Inc. to local car dealerships.… 

> Arbitragers win the first auction and resell the ad, finding exchanges where it’s more valuable and pocketing the difference. The process is over in a tenth of a second. On a typical day, the Chinatown traders’ 10-person company will arbitrage about 500 million advertisements, mostly banner ads, they said; about 30 billion ads are sold on AppNexus a day.…

Why Ad Tech Is More Complicated Than Wall Street - Martin Kihn  
http://blogs.gartner.com/martin-kihn/ad-tech-worse-wall-street/
> No, my friends, I’m afraid there is plenty of reason to think that ad tech – and particularly the world of real-time bidding, which comprises over 25% of all display impressions sold in the U.S. – that it’s just as shifty, conflicted, bewildered and disingenuously crooked as Wall Street. In fact, it’s probably worse…

> The world of ad tech processes about 400 billion transaction-like events per day, while the New York Stock Exchange processes a puny six billion trades; and programmatic ad trades use up to 100 data fields each, while a stock trade only has ten (you know, bid price, ticker symbol, etc.).…

> There’s also the sad truth that actual prices paid are obscured by layers of middle-people – for example, your ad agency’s trading desk may not tell you what they paid for those impressions, but they’ll certainly tell you what they’re charging *you* for them. Often, you as an advertiser won’t even know where they ran.…

> Michael Tiffany of White Ops, an expert in display ad impression fraud… said comparisons to credit card fraud miss the obvious point – namely, that credit card fraud affects only about 0.07% of transactions. Meanwhile, fraudulent impressions on ad networks and exchanges could be as high as 30%.

<http://www.shellypalmer.com/2015/10/the-root-of-ad-evil/>  
The Root of Ad Evil  
> Viewability and fraud are the buzzwords of the current ad crisis. No one wants to pay for an ad that cannot be seen. And absolutely nobody wants to pay for an ad that is only displayed to NHT (Non-Human Traffic). The industry is doing everything it can to increase viewability and to decrease fraud – laudable efforts to be sure, but in the meantime, nothing good is happening…

> High-quality purchased traffic is so expensive that it may not make financial sense to purchase it, so the alternative is cheap purchased traffic – and cheap purchased traffic is not worth what you pay for it. NHT is pure fraud, but some of it is necessary to dollar cost average the remainder of the order. This problem is epidemic.

<http://www.shellypalmer.com/2015/09/ad-blocking-this-time-its-serious/>  
> If you really want to be annoyed, try to read an article associated with the clickbait headline you just tapped on your phone. It will be so laden with irrelevant “content” you will not actually know where to click to get to the next few sentences. The experience (even on the best mobile optimized sites) is painful in the extreme. This is really bad for advertisers – they are not getting any value at all. It’s bad for consumers – the experience sucks! There is too much friction between the consumer and the “real” content. So the industry is about to get what it deserves – a serious spanking from a company that puts consumer experience first.

The Definition Of An Ad Impression  
> Broken ads, bot traffic, and straight-up fraud…

> We start with the notion that only 15% of impressions ever have the possibility to be seen by a real person. Then, factor in that 54% of ads are not viewable (and we already discussed how flawed that metric is), and you’re left with only 8% of impressions that have the opportunity to be seen by a real person. Let me clarify: that does not mean that 8% of impressions are seen. That means only 8% have the chance to be seen. That’s an unbelievable amount of waste in an industry where metrics are a major selling point.

> * iFrame stuffing. iFrame stuffing compresses an ad into a tiny one-by-one pixel size. The ad is served up on a site as a real ad and reported as a view, even though a real user would never be able to view such a tiny ad.

> * Ad stacking. In this type of scam, multiple ads are placed on top of each other in a single ad placement. Only the top ad is in view, but all of the ads are reported as viewed.

> These kinds of traffic fraud manipulate metrics like page views and click-through rate, making cost-per-impression a dangerous pricing model for advertisers…

> This is a chumbox. It is a variation on the banner ad which takes the form of a grid of advertisements that sits at the bottom of a web page underneath the main content.

> Clicking on a chumlink — even one on the site of a relatively high-class chummer, like nymag.com — is a guaranteed way to find more, weirder, grosser chum. The boxes are daisy-chained together in an increasingly cynical, gross funnel; quickly, the open ocean becomes a sewer of chum.

Clickbait And Traffic Laundering: How Ad Tech Is Destroying The Web

> Ad dollars are being stolen from publishers who actually put in an effort to create original, useful content…

> Time Inc celebrated its deal with OutBrain in November 2014, claiming it would bring in $100 million. That’s a paltry 3 cents per month and per unique visitor on their network of websites. In our opinion, the damage to the brand image when Times Inc visitors are redirected to trashy traffic arbitrage websites, is much higher…

> Ad tech has focused on automatization and economies of scale, which has enabled them to place low-cost ads on the murkiest of websites, because the cost of placing an ad has become so low. This rush to subprime ad space ended up hurting the high end of the market as well, as Internet users become tired of ads in general. You can only make up for low margins with volume for so long…

> Advertising agencies that fail to control for publisher quality are doomed to waste their client's money. Worse, they expose their clients to outright theft. Any system that's defined by quantitative rules ends up being gamed by smart guys, as we've illustrated above. Bad guys have caught up with ad tech's "state of the art algorithms". Any technological advantage is short-lived, and it seems that we're seeing the end of the user profiling miracle.

Unfortunately, the industry contains significant vulnerabilities that cyber criminals have used to initiate malware attacks against consumers, often without the consumers even having clicked on an advertisement, according to the findings of a nearly year-long bipartisan investigation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

> For example, in February 2014, an engineer at a security firm discovered that advertisements on YouTube served by Google’s ad network delivered malware to visitors’ computers.  In that case, the user didn’t need to click on any ads; just going to YouTube and watching a video was enough to infect the user’s computer with a virus.

> In another words, an "impression" occurs whenever one machine (an ad network) answers a request from another machine (a browser). (For reference, you can see my definition and example of a "request" in a prior Moz essay on log analytics and technical SEO.) Just in case it's not obvious: Human beings and human eyeballs have nothing to do with it. If your advertising data states than a display ad campaign had 500,000 impressions, then that means that the ad network served a browser 500,000 times—and nothing more. Digital marketers may tell their bosses and clients that "impression" is jargon for one person seeing an advertisement one time, but that statement is not accurate…

> I think we can see who the loser is—everyone is making money except for the clients…

> I have yet to hear about this issue being addressed in any talk, panel, or session at a digital marketing, martech, or adtech conference. Prior to today, I have seen only one article each in two major publications in the online marketing industry.

> Why is no one talking about this?

> No marketing agency wants clients to know that 92% of its display advertising spend is wasted. No advertising manager wants the CMO to know that only 8% of the company's ads are reaching people at 100% cost. No CMO wants the CEO to know that 92% of the entire ad budget is being flushed down the digital toilet.

Confessions of a Fake Web Traffic Buyer
> *Do you think publishers know when they’re buying fake traffic?*

> Publishers know. They might say "we had no idea" and blame it on their traffic acquisition vendor, but that's bullshit, and they know it. If you're buying visits for less than a penny, there's no way you don't understand what's going on. Any publisher that's smart enough understand an arbitrage opportunity is smart enough to understand that if it was a legitimate strategy that the opportunity would eventually disappear as more buyers crowded in. What we were doing was 100 percent intentional. Some articles revolving around bot traffic paint publishers as rubes who were duped into buying bad traffic by shady bot owners. Rather, I believe publishers are willing to do anything to make their economics work.

> *Do networks, exchanges and other ad tech companies do anything to stop this from happening?*

> We worked with a major supply-side platform partner that was just wink wink, nudge nudge about it. They asked us to explain why almost all of our traffic came from one operating system and the majority had all the same user-agent string. There was nothing I could really say to answer that question. It was their way of letting us know that they understood what was going on. It wasn’t just our account rep, either. It was people at the highest levels in the company. Part of me wished they’d said “You are in violation of our TOS and you have to stop running our tags.” I would have been happy with that. But they didn’t; they were willing to take the money.

At the end of the year, the people who had not been exposed to the advertising had bought more Fords than those who had.

> In another survey it was found that consumption of a certain brand of beer was lower among people who remembered its advertising than those who did not. The brewer had spent millions of dollars on advertising which un-sold his beer.

> I sometimes wonder if there is a tacit conspiracy among clients, media and agencies to avoid putting advertising to such acid tests. Everyone involved has a vested interest in prolonging the myth that all advertising increases sales to some degree. It doesn't.

The Website Obesity Crisis
> Here’s an article on GigaOm from 2012 titled "The Growing Epidemic of Page Bloat". It warns that the average web page is over a megabyte in size. The article itself is 1.8 megabytes long.

Here's an almost identical article from the same website two years later, called “The Overweight Web". This article warns that average page size is approaching 2 megabytes. That article is 3 megabytes long."

> Ads have become the major vector for malware.

<http://idlewords.com/2015/11/the_advertising_bubble.htm>  
> The ad technology sector is extremely complicated (I believe intentionally so).

> A customer pays money for a good or service. Some portion of the purchase goes to pay for advertising… In essence, we pay a small consumption tax to fund advertising.

> This diverted stream of money feeds a swamp of ad companies (several thousand at this point) with a complicated set of interlocking business relationships. These include companies producing desktop ads, mobile ads, ad brokers, marketplaces, platforms, the thriving consumer surveillance sector, and a new layer of startups specializing in defeating consumer countermeasures like ad blockers…

> Right now, all the ad profits flow into the pockets of a few companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Google. Everybody else is fighting to join them….

> You'll notice that the incoming and outgoing arrows in this diagram aren't equal. There's more money being made from advertising than consumers are putting in.

> The balance comes out of the pockets of investors, who are all gambling that their pet company or technology will come out a winner. They provide a massive subsidy to the adtech sector…

> (Not pictured in these diagrams is the massive arrow that is going to ad fraud).

> The only way to make the arrows balance at this point will be to divert more of each consumer dollar into advertising (raise the ad tax), or persuade people to buy more stuff.

> I doubt whether either option is viable. Compare the number of ads you see in a given day to the number of purchases you make. And consider the indirect maziness of modern advertising, with its brand awareness campaigns and social media influencers…

> The problem is not that these companies will fail (may they all die in agony), but that the survivors will take desperate measures to stay alive as the failure spiral tightens.

T> hese companies have been collecting and trafficking in our most personal data for many years. It's going to get ugly.

The Internet With A Human Face - Beyond Tellerrand 2014 Conference Talk
<http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm>>  
<https://vimeo.com/102717446>  
("Investor Storytime")  
> Advertising we all know. Someone pays you to convince your users that they'll be happy if they buy a product or service.
Advertising is really lucrative if you run your own ad network. That's like running a casino. You can't help but make money.

> If you don't run your own ad network, advertising is a scary business. You bring your user data to the altar and sacrifice it to AdSense. If the AdSense gods are pleased, they rain earnings down upon you.

> But if the AdSense gods are angry, there is wailing, and gnashing of teeth. You rend your garments and ask forgiveness, but you can never be sure what you did wrong. Maybe you pray to Matt Cutts, the intercessionary saint at Google, who has been known to descend from the clouds and speak with a human voice…

> Investor storytime is not exactly advertising, but it is related to advertising. Think of it as an advertising future, or perhaps the world's most targeted ad.

> Both business models involve persuasion. In one of them, you're asking millions of listeners to hand over a little bit of money. In the other, you're persuading one or two listeners to hand over millions of money.

> I like to think of the quote from King Lear:  
>> I will do such things,__  
>> What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be  
>> The terrors of the earth

> That's the essence of investor storytime. Give us money now, and you won't believe how awesome our ads will be when we finally put them on the site.

> King Lear would have killed it in Silicon Valley…

> We're addicted to 'big data' not because it's effective now, but because we need it to tell better stories…

<https://www.google.com/settings/ads>
> Of course, for ad sellers, the crappiness of targeted ads is a feature! It means there's vast room for improvement. So many stories to tell the investors.

> Only 5 ad platforms are supported, 2 of which are owned by Google….

Perhaps the most revealing figures this quarter are the various line items Facebook used to value WhatsApp. In the social network’s eyes, it paid $2 billion for WhatsApp’s user base; $488 million for its brand value; $288 million for its tech; and — wait for it — $15.3 billion for its “goodwill” value, which, by definition, is intangible.

## Revenue

<http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/state-of-the-news-media-2016/>  
> Since we do not have industry-wide figures, we need to rely on data from the five publicly traded companies that broke out digital vs. non-digital ad revenue in their SEC filings. Among those companies, one in every four dollars of ad revenue in 2015 came in the form of digital, a small bump up from 2014 and a sizable rise from the 5% of ad revenue digital sources made up in 2006.
