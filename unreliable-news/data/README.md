The Fake News Codex (2018-05-10 / 197 sites)   
http://www.fakenewscodex.com/

<blockquote>This site was created to identify “news” sites that are fake, extremely misleading, or satirical.  There’s no shortage of similar resources purporting to list fake news sites but they are often infrequently updated, politically slanted, or difficult to use.

The Fake News Codex does not include sites that merely have a clear political or ideological bias – Daily Kos and Breitbart will not appear here. We do include sites that are not necessarily intended to mislead (such as The Onion and its legion of imitators), but that can be misunderstood by naive readers.  These are marked with the “satire” tag.</blockquote>
